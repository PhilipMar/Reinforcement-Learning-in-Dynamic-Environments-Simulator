# Reinforcement Learning Simulator in Dynamic Environments 
 
This project is the bachelor project of Philip Martin and Timo Sturm, which was developed during the winter semester 19/20 at the University of Kassel in the department Intelligent Embedded Systems.

The goal of the project was the development of a simulator which allows the evaluation of exploration policies for active model-free reinforcement learning techniques in dynamic environments. 
The simulation environment should be based on the Maze problem known from the RL world, which changes dynamically during the training.

A detailed documentation of the project (in German language) can be found in the file "documentation.pdf".
