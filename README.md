# Reinforcement Learning Simulator in Dynamic Environments 
 
This project is the bachelor project of Philip Martin and Timo Sturm, which was developed during the winter semester 19/20 at the University of Kassel in the department Intelligent Embedded Systems.

The goal of the project was the development of a simulator which allows the evaluation of exploration policies for active model-free reinforcement learning techniques in dynamic environments. 
The simulation environment is based on the maze problem and extends it by a systematic transformation of the maze.

A detailed documentation of the project (in German language) can be found in the file named [Dokumentation.pdf](Dokumentation.pdf).
